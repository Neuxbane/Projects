Using tensorflowjs inside an Angular7 project, I am encountering trouble in accessing the numerical values of a tensor2d object.

Indeed:

let tensor2d = tf.tensor2d( [[1,2],[3,4]])
let tensor2d_array = tensor2d.dataSync()
will give an Array object of shape (4,) instead of (2,2,) as I wish.

How can I preserve the shape and get an array of my tensor. (Reshaping by hand is not practical in all cases, as I do not have access to a js matrix library in this project..).
