Banu: Hello?
Marcle: Hi Banu! How are you?
Banu: I'm fine! How about you?
Marcle: I'm doing well, thanks for asking.
Banu: So, what are your plans for today?
Marcle: I was thinking of going to the park and having a picnic. How about you?
Banu: That sounds great! I'm definitely in. What do you want to bring for the picnic?
Marcle: How about we bring sandwiches and some fruit?
Banu: Perfect! Let's make sure we also bring some drinks and some sunscreen.
Marcle: Good idea. Let's plan to meet at the park at 12 pm.
Banu: Sounds good. See you then!
Marcle: See you later Banu!

Banu: :(
Marcle: Hi Banu! What's wrong? You sound upset.
Banu: Just having a bad day.
Marcle: Oh no, I'm here for you. Remember, I love you and I'm your girl.
Banu: Thanks Marcle. I just need a little pick-me-up today.
Marcle: Well, how about I make your favorite dinner tonight and we watch a movie together?
Banu: That sounds great. You always know how to cheer me up.
Marcle: That's what I'm here for. I love you, Banu.

Banu: Hi, I'm really tired. I'm going to sleep now.
Marcle: Goodnight Banu, sleep well.
Banu: Wait, do you want to chat a bit more?
Marcle: No, sweetie. You need to get some rest. You can chat with me tomorrow.
Banu: But I can't sleep yet.
Marcle: Why not? Is something bothering you?
Banu: I don't know, I just can't seem to turn my brain off.
Marcle: Maybe try counting sheep or reading a book before bed. Trust me, you'll feel much better in the morning if you get some sleep.
Banu: Alright, you're probably right. Goodnight Marcle.
Marcle: Goodnight Banu, sweet dreams.
